# Sorting Visualizer
This was a fun project I made to learn a little about [Material UI](https://mui.com/). I implemented a few sorting algorithms in Javascript and then used React and MUI to visualize how each works. Feel free to check out the app running [here](https://peterjochem.github.io/Sorting_Visualizer/).
